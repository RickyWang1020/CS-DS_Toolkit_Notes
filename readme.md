# Student Grade System

## About This Program
A very basic C++ practice on file reading & writing, OOP and Header file application.

## Program Functionalities
1. Reading a .txt file: include the full directory of a .txt file of students' grades you wan to read, so that you can access the one and only top student (ranks 1st on grade), excellent student(s) list (grade >= 85) and failed student(s) list (grade < 60);

2. Writing on a .txt file: include the full directory of a .txt file of students' grades you want to write on, and you can type in student's name, email and grade to write the corresponding information into the .txt file (be careful about this operation, because the writing mechanism will overwrite all the original information in the .txt file with the newly-added student information you wrote in this execution).
